        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            Cliff's Homemade Ice Cream burst onto the ice cream scene like a Chocolate Gusher in March of 1975. It was
            started by a fellow by the name of Cliff Freund, an ice cream salesman, a retail businesses operator, and a
            teacher at Roxbury High School.

            Knowing what people really wanted, Cliff developed his own homemade, high-quality ice cream with original
            flavors. Since opening, Cliff's has stayed relatively the same, including their nostalgic walk-up counter.

            Over the years, Cliff's has been quietly winning award after award in national competitions. In 2003,
            Cliff's won first place for Vanilla and Strawberry flavors in a national ice cream retailers contest. They
            won second place for Sticky Bun ice cream in 2004 and took both first and second place in 2005 for Desert
            Silk and Graham Central Station. In 2006, they won second and third place for their Peach Melba and Holy
            Cannoli flavors. Cliff's was even featured on The Food Network's program "Top Five" in 2004.

            Cliff's has also continued to successfully grow and expand off-site corporate catering and concessions
            divisions of their business.</p>
